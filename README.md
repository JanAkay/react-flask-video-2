# react-flask-video-2
"summaview". An app for AI video detection and summarization using YOLOv8n nano and flask/react for GUI. 

There are a lot of dependencies that need to be met to use the application. Especially for CUDA since only one specific version in the 11.x versions work with these detection models properly. So unless you can reach me to send you a demo (it works on my pc lol) you can only use the codebase for reference and not testing.
